                        <p>Adjacent to Jamaica Plain and Roxbury, Mission Hill for most of its history was often referenced as Parker Hill (which is the name of the geographic feature in the area). After annexation (and more rapidly in recent years) the area slowly came to be considered a separate neighborhood of its own right.</h3>

                            <p>Due to the pandemic many people stopped going out and the community became disjointed due to everyone isolating.  This also hurt local businesses and many had to go out of business.  We want to try and remedy these problems and bring the community back together and help small business owners in our area by giving them free advertising.</p>
